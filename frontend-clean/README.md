## Problem Statement

80% of medical bills contain errors

- Patients struggle to answer:

- What part is covered by insurance?

- What’s truly owed out-of-pocket?

- Are there errors or duplicate charges?

Navigating medical billing and health insurance is confusing and stressful for most patients.


## Solution
HEAL.AI leverages GenAI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to:

- Analyze health insurance documents and medical bills automatically

- Summarize coverage, eligibility, and financials for patients and families

- Highlight issues: errors, duplicate or suspicious charges, coverage gaps

- Provide chat-based dispute support and personalized Q&A

- Support instant, secure access to medical records via emergency QR code

## Features
- AI-Powered Insurance & Bill Analysis: Upload policies or bills for automatic breakdown and explanation

- RAG Chatbot (Gemini 2.5 Pro Integration): Conversational Q&A, dispute guidance, and personalized clarifications

- Deductible & Copay Extraction: Find your true out-of-pocket cost fast
